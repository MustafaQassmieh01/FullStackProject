## ✅ Project Roadmap

### 🧱 PHASE 1: Setup & Base Conversion
**Goal:** Adapt the existing full stack base into the new project structure.

- [x] Copy assets, components, and backend into Vite app
- [ ] Rename links, variables, `.env` keys to match project context
- [ ] Verify frontend-backend communication (CORS, fetch/axios)
- [ ] Remove old/unused logic and code

### 🗃️ PHASE 2: Design Database Schema
**Goal:** Define the data structure and relationships.

**Entities:**

- *(Optional)* `Teacher` table or just a field in `Course`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Plan ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)
- [ ] Define and create models (with Sequelize or Mongoose)

---

### 👤 PHASE 3: Authentication & Roles
**Goal:** Implement secure login, signup, and user roles.

- [ ] Create signup/login API (bcrypt + JWT)
- [ ] Middleware for route protection (`auth`, `isStudent`, `isAdmin`)
